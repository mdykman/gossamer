 == Extensions ==
There is a file named `.extensions` in the `scripts/controllers` directory which instructs Gossamer what scripting languages to seek in response to a web request.  

For example, if a request uri `/xml/myscript` was being processed, we would search `scripts/controllers` (see [Controller#Paths Paths]); first for a file named `myscript.groovy`, next `myscript.py`, and so on. The first file found is assumed to be a script of the corresponding type which is then [#Execution executed].

In this case, once we exhaust the list, if no file is found, an error is returned. 

The is the default `.extensions` file in the Gossamer distribution
{{{
groovy
py
rb
jy
js  
jsl
php
bsh  
pnut
scm
sl
st
tcl
}}}

This extensions file applies to all the sub-directories of `scripts/controllers` as well unless they contain their own `.extensions` file to control the script loading order or to limit for specific languages.

 == Execution ==
Some scripting engines will compile scripts into byte code, other are interpreter-only.  For those engines that will compile, gossamer caches compiled scripts and watches the modified time of the source file for queues to recompile. This caching can be disabled in `gossamer.properties`

Once a script file has been selected for execution, Gossamer searches for an `__init` file having the same extension as the script and residing in the same directory.  If found, it's contents are prepended to the script before it is executed.  This is one means by which controllers may share common code.
