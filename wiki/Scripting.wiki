 == Extensions ==

There is a file name `.extensions` in the `scripts/controllers` directory which instructs Gossamer what scripting languages to seek in response to a web request.  

For example, if a request uri `/xml/myscript` was being processed, we would search `scripts/controllers`; first for a file named `myscript.groovy`, next `myscript.py`, and so on. The first file found is assumed to be a script of the corresponding type which is then [#Execution executed].

In this case, once we exhaust the list, if no file is found, an error is returned. 

The is the default `.extensions` file in the Gossamer distribution
{{{
groovy
py
rb
jy
js  
jsl
php
bsh  
pnut
scm
sl
st
tcl
}}}

This extensions file applies to all the sub-directories of `scripts/controllers` as well unless they contain their own `.extensions` file to control the script loading order or to limit for specific languages.
